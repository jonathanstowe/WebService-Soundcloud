# WebService::Soundcloud

Provide a Perl 6 interface to the Soundcloud REST API.

## Synopsis


## Description

This provides an interface to the [Soundcloud
API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/reference), managing
the authorisation, connection and marshalling of the data.

You can build client side applications that authenticate with user
credentials or server applications that use the full OAuth authorization.


## Installation

Assuming you have a working perl6 installation you should be able to
install this with *ufo* :

    ufo
    make test
    make install

*ufo* can be installed with *panda* for rakudo:

    panda install ufo

Or you can install directly with "panda":

    # From the source directory
   
    panda install .

    # Remote installation

    panda install WebService::Soundcloud

Other install mechanisms may be become available in the future.

## Support

This should be considered experimental software until such time that
Perl 6 reaches an official release.  However suggestions/patches are
welcomed via github at

   https://github.com/jonathanstowe/WebService-Soundcloud

## Licence

Please see the LICENCE file in the distribution
